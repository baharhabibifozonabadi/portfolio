                                <p>This project was conducted as part of the master's thesis of Hossein Babaei,
                                    supervised by the Department of Literature at the University of Tehran, and
                                    represents an interdisciplinary collaboration between computational methods and
                                    Persian literary scholarship. The overarching goal was to develop a system capable
                                    of reading and analyzing Persian manuscripts in the classical Nastaʿlīq script, a
                                    script known for its intricate ligatures, calligraphic flourishes, and historical
                                    variations, which pose considerable challenges for textual transcription.</p>

                                <p>My role in the project involved developing recognition techniques, curating textual
                                    corpora, and designing methodological protocols. The project began with a corpus of
                                    modern Persian texts to establish baseline transcription accuracy, and progressively
                                    included classical and historical manuscripts to address stylistic complexity and
                                    variations across time periods.</p>

                                <p>In parallel, I collaborated closely with professors of Persian literature and
                                    manuscript studies, contributing to the development of diagnostic and analytical
                                    criteria for textual validation and literary analysis. These criteria enabled the
                                    system to not only produce accurate transcriptions but also compare multiple
                                    versions of the same historical work, identify discrepancies, and support the
                                    reconstruction of original manuscripts—a process that traditionally requires years
                                    of expert scholarly work.</p>

                                <p>This work demonstrates a synergistic approach between computational techniques,
                                    literary scholarship, and manuscript studies. By integrating technical methods with
                                    humanities research, it provides a platform for the efficient study and preservation
                                    of Persian literary heritage. My contributions highlight active engagement in both
                                    technical implementation and literary-methodological design, reflecting the
                                    interdisciplinary nature of the project and its significance for advancing digital
                                    humanities research.</p>

                                <p>This project focuses on the systematic recording, transcription, and analysis of
                                    therapy session audio, aimed at producing structured digital files that capture both
                                    the verbal and interactional dynamics of therapeutic encounters. While the technical
                                    implementation of the audio recording and transcription software was handled by
                                    other team members, my role centered on the analytical and methodological aspects of
                                    the project, bridging applied psychology principles with structured data analysis.
                                </p>

                                <p>Specifically, my work involves analyzing the transcribed sessions using established
                                    note-taking and behavioral observation frameworks, such as the Gottman Method,
                                    Reflective Practice Notes, and APA Behavioral Coding standards. These methods
                                    provide a structured approach to capturing nuanced interpersonal dynamics, emotional
                                    exchanges, and behavioral patterns in therapy, allowing for both qualitative and
                                    quantitative insights. By combining these frameworks with speech and conversation
                                    analysis techniques, particularly Conversation Analysis (CA), I am able to examine
                                    turn-taking, interruptions, overlaps, speech repair strategies, and other features
                                    of spoken interaction that reveal underlying psychological processes and relational
                                    patterns.</p>

                                <p>In practice, my workflow includes carefully reviewing each transcribed session,
                                    annotating behavioral and linguistic cues, and categorizing them according to the
                                    relevant theoretical frameworks. For example, the Gottman Method helps identify
                                    relational dynamics and communication patterns within couples or group therapy,
                                    while Reflective Practice Notes allow for the therapist's subjective insights and
                                    interpretations to be systematically incorporated into the dataset. APA Behavioral
                                    Coding provides standardized categories for emotional expressions, coping
                                    mechanisms, and client engagement, enabling cross-session and cross-client
                                    comparison. Conversation Analysis then allows for detailed micro-level examination
                                    of interactional sequences, revealing patterns that might be invisible in narrative
                                    or thematic analysis alone.</p>

                                <p>The culmination of this work is a comprehensive, structured digital file for each
                                    therapy session, synthesizing multiple layers of analysis—verbal content, behavioral
                                    coding, interactional patterns, and reflective notes. These files are designed not
                                    only for therapeutic documentation and clinical review, but also for research
                                    purposes, providing a rich dataset for analyzing psychological and relational
                                    dynamics across clients and sessions. The output is both scalable and standardized,
                                    ensuring consistent application of analytical frameworks across different
                                    therapists, sessions, and therapeutic modalities.</p>

                                <p>Importantly, this product is commercially oriented and has been integrated into
                                    applied digital health services. We are collaborating with platforms such as دکترتو
                                    and اسنپ دکتر, enabling the structured session analysis to be offered as part of
                                    their suite of therapeutic services. This collaboration ensures that therapists
                                    using these platforms can benefit from high-quality session documentation, objective
                                    behavioral insights, and evidence-informed feedback to improve clinical outcomes.
                                </p>

                                <p>Overall, this project represents a sophisticated intersection of applied psychology,
                                    structured behavioral analysis, and digital service delivery, where my contributions
                                    focus on methodological rigor, analysis design, and practical implementation within
                                    real-world therapeutic contexts. It demonstrates how analytical frameworks from
                                    psychology can be operationalized into actionable digital outputs, providing
                                    meaningful support for therapists, clients, and healthcare platforms alike.</p>

                                <p>This project, conducted during 1399–1400, involved active collaboration with the
                                    pesiko psychology startup, with the goal of developing a comprehensive digital
                                    mental health education platform. The primary objective was to create a series of
                                    educational texts and videos, curated and structured within an algorithmic framework
                                    designed to deliver personalized learning experiences to users based on their
                                    individual needs and psychological profiles.</p>

                                <p>My role in the project was content creation and media production, working closely
                                    under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. I authored educational texts and
                                    produced accompanying videos that translated complex psychological concepts into
                                    accessible, engaging formats suitable for a broad audience. These materials were
                                    designed to align with evidence-based psychological knowledge and pedagogical best
                                    practices, ensuring both accuracy and usability.</p>

                                <p>The project was structured to complement monthly doctor appointments and therapy
                                    sessions, integrating digital learning with real-world therapeutic guidance. The
                                    algorithm was intended to adapt dynamically to the user's progress and needs,
                                    providing targeted content for self-guided learning, skill development, and mental
                                    health support.</p>

                                <p>Despite careful planning and production, the project encountered technical and
                                    organizational challenges, resulting in a halt before public launch. Nonetheless,
                                    the experience allowed me to combine applied psychological theory with digital
                                    content design, learning how to translate research-informed knowledge into engaging,
                                    multimedia educational products.</p>
