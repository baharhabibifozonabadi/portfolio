This project, conducted during 1399–1400, involved active collaboration with the PSYCHO psychology startup, with the goal of developing a comprehensive digital mental health education platform. The primary objective was to create a series of educational texts and videos, curated and structured within an algorithmic framework designed to deliver personalized learning experiences to users based on their individual needs and psychological profiles.

My role in the project was content creation and media production, working closely under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. I authored educational texts and produced accompanying videos that translated complex psychological concepts into accessible, engaging formats suitable for a broad audience. These materials were designed to align with evidence-based psychological knowledge and pedagogical best practices, ensuring both accuracy and usability.

The project was structured to complement monthly doctor appointments and therapy sessions, integrating digital learning with real-world therapeutic guidance. The algorithm was intended to adapt dynamically to the user’s progress and needs, providing targeted content for self-guided learning, skill development, and mental health support.

Despite careful planning and production, the project encountered technical and organizational challenges, resulting in a halt before public launch. Nonetheless, the experience allowed me to combine applied psychological theory with digital content design, learning how to translate research-informed knowledge into engaging, multimedia educational products.

Key Responsibilities and Workflow:

Authored educational texts on psychological topics, designed for accessibility and engagement.

Produced accompanying educational videos under psychologist supervision.

Assisted in conceptualizing the algorithmic curation of content for personalized user experiences.

Coordinated project planning with clinical staff and development teams to align content with therapeutic objectives.

Contributed to a proof-of-concept platform integrating digital learning and mental health support.

This project exemplifies my ability to translate theoretical psychological knowledge into practical, educational, and digitally delivered content, reflecting the interdisciplinary intersection of psychology, media production, and e-learning design.
